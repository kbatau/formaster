          <h3 style="text-align:center;">doggie's letter to master</h3>
          <p>Dear Master,</p>
          <p>Doggie thinks words are not enough to express the love and feelings I have for master, doggie doesn't feel he can find the right words but this is doggie's attempt at trying to.</p>
          <p>I wanted to tell you in every way that doggie loves you, from the moment doggie met you, from the more time doggie spent with master.</p>
          <p>I wanted to do a timeline, but not just boring one because master deserves better and more effort, and something more meaningful.</p>
          <p>So doggie thought of using gift history and tell master all the ways doggie adores and loves master.</p>
          <p>So hope master finds this letter well, because doggie loves master so much and try to show master now how much.</p>
          <p>please keep scrolling master, and know this list will always grow, and nothing wont stop doggie loving master</p>

            <p>The very first call with master, the very first game we played on voice together - doggie could tell something was different.</p>
            <p>Master knew all the right plays, knew everything that was going to happen.</p>
            <p>Master's analysis, master's critical thinking in game and in the real world - doggie admires and is amazed of how smart master is.</p>
            <p>Master is the smartest person doggie knows, thank you for teaching doggie so much each and every day, even when you are not actively teaching doggie, doggie observes master and learns so much. </p>

          <p>Master's smile is so incredibly beautiful, from each moment in 1412, every time master smiles it lights up any room she's in.</p>
          <p>Is infectious and warm, and doggie can't from smiling (and doggie doesnt know how to smile or like his own) too seeing master smile.</p>
          <p>It brings doggie so much joy and want to make master smile, master has the cutest face and when she makes the scrunchy face doggie just melts because of how enchanting and charming master is just from her smile alone.</p>

          <p>Doggie cant stop staring and gets lost in masters eyes every chance doggie gets to see Master.</p>
          <p>They are mesmermizing, and the only way doggie can feel like he can describe master's eyes is that there is a radiating feeling when master is looking at doggie</p>
          <p>a feeling that no one has ever given off, but when locked eyes with Master it's overwhelming love and warmth - to see doggie's reflection in masters eye would be the biggest blessing, and doggie would be very greatful.</p>
          <p>sorry doggie couldnt stop staring at dinner or at walks, sorry if is creepy, but they are captivating and they are the window to you</p>
          <p>and master's sweet, affectionate, compassionate, loving soul - and there's no reason for doggie to look away.</p>

            <p>Master's laugh is so sweet, and when doggie hears master laughing doggie just melts and blushes because your laugh is like the sweetest song to doggies ears.</p>
            <p>doggie wish he was more funny and can make master laugh more often, becauase master is so happy and laugh is so gleeful and cheerful, and doggie adores that.</p>
            <p>it's contagious, it's special, and doggie cherishes every moment that has made master laugh.</p>

            <p>it won't have the same effect because is not master saying it, is not coming from master's mouth</p>
            <p>the way master talks is genuine, is truthful, is soothing to doggies ears when just talking, when singing doggie gets entranced like a sailor getting lost in a maiden's song at sea.  </p>

            I hope this letter conveys even just a fraction of what master means to doggie. Master has transformed my whole world, everything doggie does - master is the reason - master is the goal. To share more moments, to laugh together, to watch shows together, to play games together, to spend time with each other.
To see your eyes sparkle, to see your infectious smile, to hear your laugh full of joy and bliss, to adore and admire how pretty and beautiful master is. With master everything else fades away, and I feel at home. Doggie wants to give all of himself to master, because master is the brightest star in the sky, not even the clearest sunset comes close to how radiant master is.
And doggie is very lucky to have these moments to treasure, and continue to be a good, behaving doggie so doggie can be greatful to be blessed with master's time again.

Forever and always, doggie loves you, with all his heart, because before meeting you doggie didn't know what true love is.
But now doggie knows that it is this.
Thank you master, I love you. </span>
